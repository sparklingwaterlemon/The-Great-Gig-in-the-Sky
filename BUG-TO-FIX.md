SET UP SO IMAGE WILL ONLY CHANGE ONCE WITH ONE UP ARROW KEY
-- is the distance traveled by the up/down arrow universal?
-- is there a default value or is it determined by some external factor like computer screen size?
-- I assume like scroll speed with mouse that can be customized by the user's computer but is there defaults to this?
